### Why is this useful?
Doing dungeons will be much easier with this mod because going for secrets that have already been done makes the dungeon take longer

### How to use
When in a dungeon do /sync (username) (username) (username) (username) then it would send a request to all those players to accept.
When the players accept, the secrets should be synced
